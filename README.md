# Memento
Script to pull shutdown codes from a given and automatically give known cause for each one. Internal database of codes will be updated as more info becomes available.

There are no additional controls with the script at the moment. It just checks, references against its database, and exits. 

TODO:
- Ability to specify how far back it will poke logs
- Potentially add colors for the naughty shutdown codes for easier visual identification of problems
- Maybe centralized shutdown code database on github? Will make updating that easier. 
- TBD
